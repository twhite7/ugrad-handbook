Undergraduate Handbook for the Department of Computer Science at the Unviersity of Virginia
===========================================================================================

This is the LaTeX source of the UVa CS undergraduate handbook that is made available to all computing majors.  The department has three undergraduate majors (BS CS, BA CS, and BS CpE).  The source for the department's [graduate handbook](https://github.com/uva-cs/grad-handbook) is also available online.

The current version will always be available, in PDF form, online at http://www.cs.virginia.edu/acad/

People should ***NOT*** look at the current working copy herein (in the various .tex files in this repository) for the current version -- the .tex files are typically works in progress, and are often edited before the changes that they describe actually take effect.  Instead, look at the latest version in the releases/ directory, as PDFs of all the formal releases (the versions that are printed) are included there.

While previous versions of the PDFs of the handbook are in the releases/ directory, all other previous files (diagrams, flowcharts, various documents, etc.) are kept in the "archive" branch.

The primary author of this handbook is [Aaron Bloomfield](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/) (aaron@virginia.edu, [@bloomfieldaaron](https://twitter.com/bloomfieldaaron), [github.com/aaronbloomfield](github.com/aaronbloomfield)).  If you have any suggestions, corrections, etc., please either [execute a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) or contact him.
