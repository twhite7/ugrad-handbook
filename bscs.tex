\mysection{Introduction}

% this intro drafted by Mark, and sent via e-mail on 9-6-11

The Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science is a wide-ranging
program, encompassing both the theoretical and the practical.  This
program builds upon the engineering and mathematical principles
introduced in the Engineering School's core curriculum.  Our students
are then taught to apply computing to the world around them by building
faster, smaller, and more secure software systems, exploring emerging
technologies, and working on real-world problems.  Our courses focus
on teaching students how to recognize computational challenges, create
elegant and efficient algorithms, and then use rigorous development
methodologies to build systems that can solve pressing
problems. Graduates of the BS program find successful careers with
traditional software companies, government agencies, consulting firms,
academia, and companies in other fields that have software needs.
Computing professions are often ranked near the top in ``Best Job''
lists put together by news organizations for job availability, pay,
and satisfaction.

Course work in the BS CS program starts with several courses that
introduce the basic principles of software creation, from learning
programming languages to advanced development techniques.  Once
students have mastered the basics, the bulk of our program opens up,
offering electives in several exciting fields, including networking,
security, game design, web programming, e-commerce, parallel
computing, and much more.  Students have the opportunity to take
several electives each semester, as our department offers more
electives than the other departments in the Engineering School. 

\mysection{Application Process}
\label{bscsapplicationprocess}

The application requirements in this section are the same as for the
Computer Engineering degree.

The Department of Computer Science is experiencing tremendous student
interest in our degree programs. Our goal is to accommodate as many
undergraduate majors as possible. However, because of current
resources, there is an enrollment cap on the total number of
majors in the BS in Computer Science (BS CS) and the BS in Computer
Engineering (BS CpE) degree programs.

{\bf First-year students:} All first-year Engineering students choose
their major in the Spring semester of their first year. At that time,
students seeking either the BS CS or BS CpE major will submit their
application information as part of the normal first-year SEAS major
declaration process, which the SEAS Dean's office manages. Since the
cap is on the {\em combined} number of BS CS and BS CpE majors, a
student's chance of acceptance will not be affected by choosing one
over the other. All applicants will be notified of admission decisions
by early summer.

{\bf Engineering students changing majors or seeking a second major:}
Declared BS CS or BS CpE majors can change from one major to the other
at any time, and they can declare the other major as their second
major without applying. However, other engineering students who want
to declare the BS CS or BS CpE as a second major, and students who want
to change their first major to either of these, must apply. The
available space given our target caps for each class year may be a
factor. Application deadlines for such requests will be October 15 and
February 15. The application form can be found
online\myurl{http://www.cs.virginia.edu/acad/declaring.html}.

All third and fourth year students who want to declare the BS CS major
as a first or second major must have already completed CS 2190 or will
need to complete CS 2190 by the end of their third year.

At this time, SEAS students are not eligible to apply for the BA CS
(i.e., the College degree) as a second major.

{\bf Intra-University Transfer Students:} SEAS accepts transfer
app\-li\-ca\-tions for non-SEAS UVa students, currently once a year. The
application deadline and process is described on this SEAS
web page\myurl{http://www.seas.virginia.edu/advising/transferseas.php}.
Qualified applicants who want to transfer into SEAS to become BS CS or
BS CpE majors will be considered on a space-available basis given our
target caps for each class year. Such students should follow the SEAS
application process, and must contact the Computer Science department
contact person or the Electrical and Computer Engineering department
contact person listed in the SEAS web page before applying.

{\bf Transfer students from outside the University:} Students
transferring into the University from other institutions must apply to
the department to be allowed to declare the BS CS or BS CpE major.
Qualified applicants will be considered on a space-available basis,
given our target caps for each class year. Applications will be
considered the summer before a transfer student begins classes, and
the application process will be discussed during the summer
orientation session. If an incoming transfer does not attend summer
orientation, they must meet with a department advisor before classes
begin to discuss applying.

Due to prerequisite dependencies, it is difficult for rising third year
students who have not completed CS 2110 and CS 2102 to complete the
BS CS in the 4 remaining semesters. It is important that students
transferring to the University as third year students complete the equivalent
of these courses before coming to UVa. In exceptional cases, students
in this situation may apply for the major, but the ability to complete
the degree in a timely fashion is considered in determining if
you are accepted into the degree program.


\mysection{Curriculum}

The requirements for the computer science degree consist of a number
of required courses, as well as a series of elective choices for the
student to make.  A table of all the requirements is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:bscsreqs} (page~\pageref{fig:bscsreqs}).

\subsection{Elective Information}
\label{sec:electiveinfo}

The numbers in the list below correspond to the footnote numbers from
the sample course schedule shown in section~\ref{sec:bscsschedule}
(page~\pageref{sec:bscsschedule}).

\begin{enumerate}

\item Science elective (1 required): Students must choose one of BIOL
  2010 (Introduction to Biology: Cell Biology and Genetics),
  BIOL 2020 (Introduction to Biology: Organismal and
  Evolutionary Biology), CHEM 1620 (Introductory Chemistry for
  Engineers), ECE 2066 (Science of Information), ENGR 2500
  (Introduction to Nano\-science and Technology), MSE 2090
  (Introduction to the Science and Engineering of Materials), or PHYS
  2620 (Introductory Physics IV: Quantum Physics). Additional
  courses in this list can count as an unrestricted elective.

\item HSS electives (5 required): Studies in the humanities and social
  sciences serve not only to meet the objectives of a broad education,
  but also to meet the objectives of the engineering profession. Such
  course work must meet the generally accepted definitions that the
  humanities are the branches of knowledge concerned with humankind
  and its culture, while the social sciences are the studies of
  society. See the full list of allowed courses in the SEAS
  Undergraduate Handbook. This list can be found
  online\myurlremember{hss}{http://www.seas.virginia.edu/advising/undergradhandbook.php}
  and in this handbook in section~\ref{hsselectives}. Note that there
  are a number of courses that do not count as HSS electives, but
  would count as an unrestricted elective. See the URL for details.
  Note that three of the five HSS electives are required by SEAS, and
  the other two are required by the CS department; however, all five
  must comply with the SEAS requirements for HSS electives, or must be
  approved through the petition process described in the SEAS
  undergraduate handbook\myurlrecall{hss}.

\item Unrestricted elective (5 required): Any graded course in the
  University, with a few exceptions. From the SEAS Undergraduate
  Student Handbook\myurlrecall{hss}:
  ``Unrestricted Electives may be chosen from any graded course in the
  University except mathematics courses below MATH 1310, including
  STAT 1100 and 1120, and courses that substantially duplicate any
  others offered for the degree, including PHYS 2010, PHYS 2020, CS
  1010, CS 1020, or any introductory programming course. Students in
  doubt as to what is acceptable to satisfy a degree requirement
  should obtain the approval of their adviser and the dean's office,
  Thornton Hall, Room A122. APMA 1090 counts as a three credit
  unrestricted elective for students.''  Note that Band classes (such
  as marching band) and ROTC classes can count for the unrestricted
  elective.

\item APMA elective (2 required): Must choose two from: APMA 2130
  (Ordinary Differential Equations), APMA 3080 (Linear
  Algebra) or APMA 3120 (Statistics). Note that APMA 3100
  (Probability) is a required course in addition to the two APMA
  electives.

\item CS electives (5 required): Any 3 credit CS class at the 3000
  level or above. A course that is fulfilling another requirement
  cannot count as a CS elective. If you take more than five CS
  electives, you can count additional CS elective course(s) as
  unrestricted electives. Note that
  % ECE 4435 (Computer Architecture \& Design) and
  ECE 4440 (Embedded Systems Design) can count as a CS elective, but
  see the details in section~\ref{bscscpedoublemajors}
  (page~\pageref{bscscpedoublemajors}).  Due to substantial overlap with
  CS 3330 (Computer Architecture), ECE 4435 (Computer Architecture \&
  Design) can NOT count as a CS elective.  CS 4993
  (Independent Study) can be used at the most once for a CS elective
  (i.e. no more than 3 credits); additional CS 4993 credits can be
  used as unrestricted electives. Note that for a class that does not
  meet these requirements to count as a CS elective requires approval
  by the CS undergraduate curriculum committee (NOT by the student's
  academic advisor); this process can be initiated by emailing the BS
  CS director at \bscsdirectoremail. 
  % the following paragraph is no longer relevant if ECE 4435 does not
  % count as a CS elective any more
  %  
  % Due to substantial overlap, one cannot get credit for both ECE 4435
  % and CS 4330. Thus, if a student takes both of those classes, the
  % other one can ONLY count as a unrestricted elective.

\item STS 2xxx/3xxx elective (1 required): Any STS course at the
  2000-level or 3000-level.
\end{enumerate}
 
Note: classes that receive no grade (including classes that are
audited) do not count toward your degree requirements.

\subsection{Capstone Sequence}
\label{capstone-section}

All SEAS students must complete a senior thesis, which is encapsulated
in the STS 4500 and STS 4600 courses.  In addition to the STS courses,
BS CS students must complete one or two CS courses to fulfill the
computer science capstone sequence requirement.  There are two
``tracks'' to complete the capstone, described below, and students may
choose either track.

Formally, students must complete 3 credits of one of the two capstone
courses, depending on which track they choose to
fulfill: either CS 4971 (Capstone Practicum II) for the Capstone
Practicum track, or CS 4980 (Research Capstone) for the Research
Capstone track.  But note that CS 4970 (Capstone Practicum I), which
is a CS elective, is a strict prerequisite to CS 4971!  Also note
that STS 4500 and STS 4600 must {\bf still} be taken; the CS courses
are in addition to, not instead of, the STS courses.

\subsubsection{Research Capstone Track}

This track is intended for students who are interested in performing
an independent project, either a research-based project or an
implementation-based project.  The student must seek out a faculty
member, who will agree to advise the project.  The requirements of the
project, workload, etc., are to be agreed upon by the student and
advisor.  Students will receive 3 credits for CS 4980 (Research
Capstone), which is what formally fulfills the capstone requirement
for the degree.  Faculty advisors may decide to assign the three
credits in a single semester, or spread the three credits across
multiple semesters; as long as three credits are eventually earned,
then the requirement will be fulfilled.  Group projects are up to the
discretion of the advisor, but are certainly permissible.  Large
projects may receive additional credit through CS 4993 (Independent
Study), but this is solely up to the advisor.  Note that there is a
maximum of 3 credits (1 course) of CS electives that that CS 4993 may
count toward; any additional credits count toward the unrestricted
elective requirement.

This track is essentially how the senior thesis technical requirement
worked previously, except that students now receive three credits for
the technical work performed.

\subsubsection{Capstone Practicum Track}

This track is intended for any students who are not planning on
performing an independent project.  Students under this track will
register for CS 4970 (Capstone Practicum I) in the fall of their 4th
year, and CS 4971 (Capstone Practicum II) in the spring of their 4th
year~-- specifically, those classes are to be taken concurrently with
STS 4500 and STS 4600, respectively.  Both of these CS courses are 3
credits.

These two courses form a year-long project implementation course.
Students will be grouped into teams, will have requirements, real
customers to interact with, real deadlines, and will need to complete
real deliverables.  While the domain of the course is up to the
instructor, the current implementation of the courses is a Service
Learning Practicum\myurl{http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/slp/}.

Note that only CS 4971 counts toward the capstone requirement; CS 4970
is a CS elective.  However, CS 4970 is a {\bf strict} prerequisite to
CS 4971.  In particular, because the projects are year-long
group-based projects, there will be absolutely no allowances for
students to join the sequence for just CS 4971 in the spring semester.


\subsubsection{Double Majors and the Capstone}

A SEAS student who is double majoring with the BS CS and another SEAS
degree must complete the capstone or major design experience (MDE)
course requirements in their non-CS major {\bf in addition to} the
capstone sequence in the computer science major.  This means that they
will still have to take either CS 4980 (Research Capstone) or the
practicum capstone sequence (CS 4970 and CS 4971). Students can
negotiate with their capstone/MDE instructors and their STS instructor
which degree program's work will be used to satisfy the STS thesis
portfolio requirements. However, the student should be aware that the
capstone/MDE instructors in both departments will almost certainly
require some kind of documentation of the technical work done for that
program's requirement.

The degree requirement checklist is shown in figure~\ref{fig:bscsreqs}
(page~\pageref{fig:bscsreqs}), and is available

\subsection{Sample BS CS Course Schedule}
\label{sec:bscsschedule}

Below is the recommended course of study for the bachelor's degree. If
one has already completed some of these classes (through AP credit,
for example), then your course of study would deviate from what is
shown below~-- consult your academic advisor for details.

There are a total of six types of electives that the student can
choose from. These electives are indicated by the footnotes below, and
are described in detail in section~\ref{sec:electiveinfo}
(page~\pageref{sec:electiveinfo}). Note that some of these
requirements are for all SEAS students, while others are required for
the CS bachelor's degree. Please be aware of when the classes are
offered! Some are only offered once per year, or in a particular
semester. See section~\ref{sec:coursedesc}
(page~\pageref{sec:coursedesc}) for details as to when courses are
offered.

The recommended schedule shown below has changed slightly each year as
the degree requirements have evolved. As discussed in the Degree
Requirement Revisions (section~\ref{sec:degreerevisions},
page~\pageref{sec:degreerevisions}), a student can graduate using any
set of requirements that were in effect when they became a declared
computer science major. Thus, as long as all the major requirements
are met, students can follow a previous version of the recommended
course schedule.

Academic requirements are managed by SIS (UVa's Student Information
System), which is where your individual set of requirements can be found.
%A sample of the BS CS requirement listing can be found
%online\myurl{http://www.cs.virginia.edu/bscs/bscs-reqs-in-sis.pdf}.

\mysection{Miscellaneous Information}

\subsection{GPA Requirement}

Students must have a 2.0 GPA in all computer science courses in order to complete the degree.  This means all courses with a ``CS'' courses as well as the ECE versions of CS 2330 (Digital Logic Design) and CS 4457 (Computer Networks).  A cumulative GPA less than 2.0 in these courses will prevent successful completion of the degree.  Note that the University policy for Engineering students is such that if you take a course multiple times, then {\em all} of the grades received will count toward the GPA.

\subsection{CS 2190 Specific Details}

While students can take courses in any semester, there is an issue to
consider with CS 2190: this course should be taken in the second year
or (less preferably) the third year. If a student reaches his/her
fourth year without taking the course, then s/he must take a 3 credit
course in ethics and technology in its place (even though CS 2190 is
only 1 credit). This course taken in place of CS 2190 does not count
toward any other requirement except to replace CS 2190.
